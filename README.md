Hello and welcome to QuickTutor!

To use, login and enter as a Student or a Tutor. You can be both, just only one at time :)

Once your profile is made, as a Student you can submit a request to be tutored in a specific UVA course.

As a tutor, you can accept a request to tutor in any UVA course of your specialty. 

Students then have the option to view all tutors that accepted their request for tutoring, viewing year, major, picture, and rating before choosing which tutor to enter a session with. The chosen tutor is redirected to the session (nice!) and all other tutors are "kicked out" back to the request page (dang, better luck time time!).

Meeting details appears for the student/tutor pair to find each other and the tutor has the button to start the session timer, which starts counting on both screens when pressed. Either tutor or student can end the session, and both are redirected to the postsession page to rate each other, file any complaints, and for the student to pay the tutor.

Either students or tutors can edit their profile information (year, major, picture, etc.) at anytime for others to see by hitting the "Edit Profile" button. And as a tutor, you can always add new courses to your skillset to tutor in by editing your profile!

Students can cancel the request free of charge, before choosing from the list of tutors.
